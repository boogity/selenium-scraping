# Dependencies

## Python Modules
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Web Browser Driver
You should no longer need to manually download a browser driver for Selenium to work, it should do it for you as of 4.6+

## Web Browser
You will still need a browser though. I'll be using google-chrome throughout this as it's what the web browser driver is searching for.
- Download debian, install package
- Ensure google-chrome binary is in your $PATH
